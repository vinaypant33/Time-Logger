##  App Approach : 
    1. Controller works as the main app and then the controller calls the another classes and controls overall look and feel of the application 

    2. Controller only works as the base app the each class is the app in its own



will proceed with the second approcach and then if needed will shift into the first approach 



## Open Issues  : 

- [ ] The second top form opens in differne location while after calling it from seperate class it opens perfectly
        Code class task frame ( init ) main_page ( calling from the main app)
- [ ] Closing the form producess an error - Check and close the error 

- [ ] UI a little bit complucated and not so good to use  :
